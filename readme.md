Secret Recipes utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to allow users to buy and sell unique recipes. This means no duplicate recipes can exist on the blockchain at once and recipes have a direct value. As a recipe is bought and sold multiple times, its price will increase. This adds value to the recipe over time. After a lengthy period of trading, a recipe will have aged and been kitchen-tested many times, validating the higher price it is now worth.
